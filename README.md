# ispgendedupstats
Bash script that run through IBM Spectrum Protect diretctoy storagepools and calculates statistics for each node in that pool. 
It returns a script to run manually since we should audit it before run, but remove remark to run automatically.


Decided to share this script since the new 8.1 generate dedupstats command lacks pause and memory leak has been found but fix is still not ready.
