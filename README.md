# ispgendedupstats
Bash script that run through IBM Spectrum Protect Diretctoy pools and calculates statistics for each node in that pool. 
It returns a script to run manually since we might need to edit, remove remark to run automatically.

Decided to puplish this script since the new 8.1 generate dedupstats command lacks pause and memory leak has been detected running it.
